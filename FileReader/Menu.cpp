 * Program name: Langston's Ant
 * Author: Steven Owens
 * Date: 10/8/2019
 * Description:  Langston's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine
 *               invented by Chris Langston in 1986.  It is a cellular automation
 *               created on a black and white game board re-created in c++ using
 *               in the console using the char '#' for black and ' ' for white.
 *               The game board implementation is a dynamically allocated 2D array
 *               of characters on the heap. The user is prompted by a console menu
 *               for 5 integers (rows, columns, steps, ant starting row and ant
 *               starting column) as inputs to setup the game parameters.  Once
 *               the user is satisfied with the setup, the simulations continues
 *               until the number of steps reaches 0.  An additional replay feature
 *               allows the user to run the simulation again.

 *        use a generic user input Menu.

 * Summary: Primary method for user input, handles all logic and console prompts to facilitate user input
 *          and validation of entry of only positive integer values.  Ensuring that the Ant startRow and
 *          startColumn are within the bound of the game board is handled by the AntGame class once returned
 *          as a vector.
 * Param: int choice which by default is 0 from hpp definition, this allows passing in a value for the replay
 *        functionality.
 * Returns: std::vector<int> which are the 5 integers required for instantiation of objects in AntGame.
